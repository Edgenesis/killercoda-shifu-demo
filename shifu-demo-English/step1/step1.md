🌟In order to use Shifu Cloud, you'll first need a **Kubernetes cluster** on your computer.

🧑🏼‍💻We've configured a Kubernetes cluster for you to try out directly.

🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹

Use this command `kubectl get nodes`{{execute}} to check the status of the nodes in the current Kuberenetes cluster.

🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹
We can see that the current Kubernetes cluster contains one `node`-`controlplane`, and the `status` is `Ready`.
```
controlplane $ kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
controlplane   Ready    control-plane   2d16h   v1.26.0
node01         Ready    <none>          2d16h   v1.26.0
```
